        <h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

        <p>Just run the following command from your shell:</p>

<pre><code>$ wget -q -O - http://tserong.github.io/sudo-wget/install | sudo bash
</code></pre>

        <h3>Why This is a Bad Idea</h3>

        <p>Let's look at that command in detail.  It's downloading something via
        HTTP (which is unencrypted and provides no guarantee of authenticity)
        and then executes whatever was downloaded in a root shell.  Here's
        a non-exhaustive list of potential problems:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A transparent proxy or other bit of trickery on the network
          between you and the server could be tampering with or replacing what
          you're downloading.</li>
          <li>DNS cache poisoning could have directed your request to some
          other site, again delivering potentially malicious code.</li>
          <li>Someone (not the author of the install script) could have
          compromised the server and replaced said script with something nasty.</li>
          <li>That potentially nasty, unverified piece of code that you haven't
          reviewed yourself is being executed immediately with root permissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Can This Be Fixed</h3>

        <p>If you presently recommend any variant of the above command for
        installation or bootstrapping your software, stop doing that immediately.
        Instead, try one of these alternatives:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If your install script is sufficiently short, just publish the
          commands to run in your installation documentation.</li>
          <li>If your script is long and complicated, offer it for download
          along with MD5 and SHA1 signatures of the file, then encourage your
          users to check both before running the script.  Better yet, PGP sign
          it and encourage your users to verify the signature.  Make sure you
          serve the MD5, SHA1 and PGP signatures over SSL.</li>
          <li>If it's Linux software, see if you can dispense with standalone
          install scripts entirely and instead build proper signed packages
          (the <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/">Open Build Service</a> can
          build packages for various Linux distros which will be signed by the
          build system's PGP key).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are a user of some software which recommends any variant of
        the above command, please point the author of said software to this
        page.</p>
